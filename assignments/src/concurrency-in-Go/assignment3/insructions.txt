Students will receive five points if the program sorts the integers 
and five additional points if there are four goroutines that each prints out a set of array elements that it is storing.
========================================================================================================================
Write a program to sort an array of integers. 
The program should partition the array into 4 parts, 
each of which is sorted by a different goroutine. 
Each partition should be of approximately equal size.

Then the main goroutine should merge the 4 sorted subarrays into one large sorted array.

The program should prompt the user to input a series of integers. 
Each goroutine which sorts Â¼ of the array should print the subarray that it will sort. 
when sorting is complete, the main goroutine should print the entire sorted list.
