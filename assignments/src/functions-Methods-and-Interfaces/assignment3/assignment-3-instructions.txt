This assignment is worth a total of 10 points.

Test the program by running it and testing it by issuing three requests. 
Each request should involve a different animal (cow, bird, snake) and a different property of the animal (eat, move, speak). 
Give 2 points for each request for which the program provides the correct response.

Examine the code. 
If the code contains a type called Animal,
 which is a struct containing three fields, 
 all of which are strings, then give another 2 points. 
 If the program contains three methods called Eat(), Move(), and Speak(), 
 and all of their receiver types are Animal, give another 2 points.
